# node_test3

Install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

In the project directory, install the required dependencies by running the following command:
npm install

Configure the MongoDB connection by modifying the db.js file. Replace the url variable with your MongoDB connection string, and set the dbName variable to your desired database name.

Start the MongoDB server by running the mongod command in a separate terminal or command prompt window.

Running the API
In the project directory, start the API server by running the following command:


node server.js
The API will start running on http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

GET /students: Fetch all the students from the database.
GET /students/:id: Fetch a specific student by their ID from the database.
POST /students: Create a new student in the database.
PUT /students/:id: Update an existing student in the database.
DELETE /students/:id: Delete a specific student by their ID from the database.

Challenge

1.Challenge: Connecting to the MongoDB database and ensuring a successful connection.
Solution: Used the MongoDB driver and implemented a connect function in db.js to establish a connection to the database. Checked for successful connection using await client.connect().

2.Challenge: Handling errors during database operations, such as inserting, updating, or deleting documents.

Solution: Implemented try-catch blocks in the API endpoints to catch any errors that may occur during database operations. Proper error messages and status codes were returned in the response to indicate the failure.
